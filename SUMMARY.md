**Vehicle Wheel Detection | Axle Detection** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the automotive industry. 



The dataset consists of 675 images with 2993 labeled objects belonging to 8 different classes including *wheel*, *2_wheeler*, *3_wheeler*, and other: *4_wheeler*, *6_wheeler*, *8_wheeler*, *auto*, and *10_wheeler*.

Images in the Vehicle Wheel Detection dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 6 (1% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2023 by the [DataCluster Labs, India](http://www.datacluster.ai).
