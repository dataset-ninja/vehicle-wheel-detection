**Vehicle Wheel Detection** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the construction industry. 

The dataset consists of 675 images with 2993 labeled objects belonging to 8 different classes including *wheel*, *2_wheeler*, *3_wheeler*, and other: *4_wheeler*, *6_wheeler*, *8_wheeler*, *auto*, and *10_wheeler*.

Images in the Vehicle Wheel Detection dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 6 (1% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds* (675 images). The dataset was released in 2023 by the [Data Cluster Labs](http://www.datacluster.ai).

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 8 classes:
